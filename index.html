			<p>Hello, nice to meet you!<br><br>My name is Daniela Draganova. I am a finance student at UNWE that is The economy University in my native city.<br> I have recently become interested in web design and I really want professional development in this field. I am from Bulgaria, Sofia and I live with my wonderful boyfriend Stanislav.<br> He is an amazing programming specialist who actually gave me the idea to start studying Front-end especially HTML, CSS, JavaScript and etc.</p>

			<p>Now I will tell you an intersting story about me. Before a month ago I fell ill with Covid-19. It was terrible. As we all already know, people with Covid need to isolate themselves and stop contact with other people. I stayed home for about two weeks and wondered how to spend all this free time. On the fifth day of the quarantine, I decided to order some basic painting materials. The shipment arrived and I was surrounded by canvases,acrylic paints, brushes and whatnot. I admit, I had no idea what exactly to do with them, but I had a great desire to start painting. I started watching different videos on You Tube, which really helped me a lot. Finishing my first painting, I was left breathless. It really became quite successful. Keep in mind that I have never been involved in painting and these were my first steps in art.And now I would like to present you all my works so far.</p>
